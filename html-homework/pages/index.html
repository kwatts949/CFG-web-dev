          The Highland (Scottish Gaelic: Bò Ghàidhealach; Scots: Hielan coo) is
          a Scottish breed of rustic beef cattle. It originated in the Scottish
          Highlands and the Western Islands of Scotland and has long horns and a
          long shaggy coat. It is a hardy breed, able to withstand the
          intemperate conditions in the region. The first herd-book dates from
          1885; two types – a smaller island type, usually black, and a larger
          mainland type, usually dun – were registered as a single breed. It is
          reared primarily for beef, and has been exported to several other
          countries.
